        Welcome to Jekyll Boilerplate

        You can download this template via git in a zip or clone the                 repository directly to your directory of choice.
        
        <code>git clone https://github.com/BillyPurvis/jekyll-boilerplate.git</code>
    </p>
        
    <p class="content-text">
        You'll need to have the Jekyll and Sass Ruby Gem installed, nodeJS,
        NPM to install the required dependencies for development. To 
        install the node modules, you can run 

        <code>npm install</code>
        
        for development. You'll also need gulp globally installed. 
    </p>
       
    <p class="content-text">
        The template is simple, the scss files are in the _sass dir and are 
        being watched by gulp for changes, then Jekyll will be rebuilt into           _site which is then run via gulp-connect on port 4000. 
    </p>
       
    <p class="content-text">
        Jekyll's files are being watched too, adding a new directory, such as         /contact/index.html, gulp will recognize the new directory when               gulp serve task is run. 
    </p>
       
    <p class="content-text">
        To create drafts, store them into _drafts and when ready, you can 
        move to the _posts directory for production.
